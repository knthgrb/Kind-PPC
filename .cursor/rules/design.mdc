# Apple Design Principles

## General Rule

**Always follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and design principles.** Create interfaces that are modern, clean, simple, and aesthetically pleasing while prioritizing clarity and usability.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Clarity

- Use clear, legible text with appropriate font sizes
- Ensure icons and images are crisp and meaningful
- Make interactive elements obvious and discoverable
- Use clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention

### 2. Deference

- UI should defer to content, not compete with it
- Minimize chrome and unnecessary UI elements
- Use subtle backgrounds and borders
- Let content be the hero

### 3. Depth

- Use subtle shadows and layering to create visual hierarchy
- Implement smooth transitions and animations
- Create a sense of depth through elevation and z-index
- Use blur effects (backdrop-filter) sparingly and appropriately

### 4. Simplicity

- Keep interfaces clean and uncluttered
- Remove unnecessary elements
- Use whitespace generously
- One primary action per screen when possible

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Spacing & Layout

- Use generous padding and margins (minimum 16px, prefer 20-24px for major sections)
- Maintain consistent spacing scale (4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
- Use grid-based layouts with proper alignment
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px

### Typography

- Prefer system fonts (SF Pro on Apple devices, system-ui fallback)
- Use clear font hierarchy (headings, body, captions)
- Maintain readable line heights (1.5-1.6 for body text)
- Use appropriate font weights (regular, medium, semibold)

### Colors

- Use subtle, refined color palettes
- Prefer neutral backgrounds (whites, light grays)
- Use color purposefully and sparingly
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)
- Use semantic colors (success, warning, error) consistently

### Borders & Shadows

- Use subtle borders (1px, light colors)
- Prefer rounded corners (8px, 12px, 16px for cards/buttons)
- Use soft shadows sparingly (subtle elevation)
- Avoid heavy borders and harsh shadows

### Animations & Transitions

- Keep animations smooth and purposeful (200-300ms typical)
- Use easing functions (ease-in-out, ease-out)
- Animate properties that affect layout sparingly
- Provide reduced motion support when appropriate

## Component Design

### Buttons

- Use rounded corners (8-12px)
- Generous padding (12-16px vertical, 20-24px horizontal)
- Clear visual states (default, hover, active, disabled)
- Primary actions should be prominent but not overwhelming

### Cards & Containers

- Use subtle backgrounds and borders
- Generous padding (16-24px)
- Rounded corners (12-16px)
- Subtle shadows for elevation when needed

### Forms

- Clear labels and placeholders
- Generous input padding
- Clear focus states
- Helpful error messages
- Logical grouping of related fields

### Navigation

- Clear, consistent navigation patterns
- Obvious active states
- Smooth transitions between views
- Breadcrumbs or clear hierarchy indicators

## Implementation Guidelines

### CSS/Tailwind Classes

- Prefer Tailwind's spacing scale
- Use `rounded-lg` (8px), `rounded-xl` (12px), `rounded-2xl` (16px)
- Use subtle shadows: `shadow-sm`, `shadow-md` (avoid heavy shadows)
- Use `backdrop-blur` sparingly for modern glass effects
- Prefer `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out` for smooth animations

### Color Usage

- Use neutral grays for backgrounds: `bg-gray-50`, `bg-white`
- Use subtle borders: `border-gray-200`, `border-gray-300`
- Use color purposefully: primary brand color for CTAs, semantic colors for states
- Avoid overly saturated colors

### Spacing

- Use consistent spacing: `p-4` (16px), `p-5` (20px), `p-6` (24px)
- Maintain breathing room between elements
- Group related elements with consistent spacing

## Examples

### Good Design

- Clean, spacious layouts with generous whitespace
- Subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Smooth, purposeful animations
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Content-first approach
- Consistent spacing and alignment

### Bad Design

- Cluttered interfaces with too many elements
- Heavy borders and harsh shadows
- Jarring or unnecessary animations
- Unclear visual hierarchy
- UI competing with content
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment

## Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Provide clear focus states
- Support keyboard navigation
- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alternative text for images
- Support reduced motion preferences
